# CODSOFT-AI-TASK-Project
Codsoft Ai(Artificial intelligence) Task Project Submision 💻👍🏻🙏🏻

All 5 Task Completed 👍👍  :
1. Task 1 CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASEDRESPONSES.
   
2. Task 2 TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toeagainst a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax withor without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic searchalgorithms.

3. Task 3 IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to buildan image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition modelslike VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use arecurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model togenerate captions for those images.

4. Task 4 RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items tousers based on their preferences. You can use techniques likecollaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommendmovies, books, or products to users.

6. TASK 5: FACE DETECTION ANDRECOGNITION
Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces inimages or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haarcascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionallyadd face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamesenetworks or ArcFace.
